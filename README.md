# PG Keycloak
Just my Docker Image of Keycloak with support for Docker secrets.

Now with github actions automated!

Image available at Dockerhub  
`docker pull dsbferris/pg-keycloak:latest`   
or Github  
`docker pull ghcr.io/dsbferris/pg-keycloak:latest`

As of 26.0.7 every build will be tagged the same way the upstream image is.
NOTE: github actions script will only build from upstream latest.
